            Disables a market without removing its configuration. <br />
            The market maker bot will no longer place new orders on this market until you re-enable it via the enable action.<br />
            However any existing orders will stay in place and need to be managed manually by the user. <br /><br />
            
            Note that disabled markets still count towards your maximum allowed number of markets <br />
            (basic service accounts can have 1 market configured; premium service accounts can have unlimited markets).
