                Disables a market without removing its configuration.
                The market maker bot will no longer place new orders on this market until you re-enable it via the enable action.
                However any existing orders will stay in place and need to be managed manually by the user.

                Note that disabled markets still count towards your maximum allowed number of markets 
                (basic service accounts can have 1 market configured; premium service accounts can have unlimited markets).
