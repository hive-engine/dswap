            Upgrades a previously registered account to premium service.<br />
            An upgrade fee of ${marketMakerUpgradeCost} ${marketMakerFeeToken} is required and the account must have at least ${marketMakerStakeRequiredPremium} ${marketMakerFeeToken} staked. <br />
            <br />
            Some things to note:<br />
            <ol>
                <li>${marketMakerFeeToken} that is in the process of being unstaked will not count toward the staking requirement of ${marketMakerStakeRequiredPremium} tokens.</li>
                <li>If an account is on cooldown, upgrading it will remove the cooldown.</li>
                <li>
                    It is possible for an account to lose premium status later on, for example if the amount of staked ${marketMakerFeeToken} falls<br />
                    below the minimumed required threshold of ${marketMakerStakeRequiredPremium} tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an account previously had premium status (but lost it), the upgrade fee doesn't need to be paid again.<br />
                    However the staking requirement must still be met.
                </li>
            </ol>
            If an account loses premium status later on, there may also be secondary side effects.<br />
            For instance, premium users are allowed to have unlimited markets configured for bot trading, but basic <br />
            service allows only one. So if you lose premium status but have multiple markets configured, they will all<br />
            be disabled until you have removed the extra markets or upgraded to premium again.<br /><br />
            If you already have an active market configured in your basic account, <br />
            please make sure your stake covers the upgrade fee (${marketMakerStakeRequiredPremium} ${marketMakerFeeToken}) + market creation fee (${marketMakerStakeRequiredPerMarket}  ${marketMakerFeeToken}).<br />
            If you don't have enough stake, your active market will be disabled until you meet the staking requirement.<br />
            <br />
            Your ${marketMakerFeeToken} balance: ${userBalanceFeeToken} ${marketMakerFeeToken}<br />
            Your ${marketMakerFeeToken} stake: ${userStakeFeeToken} ${marketMakerFeeToken}
